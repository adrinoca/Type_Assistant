# Type_Assitant

## Context

Typing Assistant provides the ability to autocomplete words and suggests predictions for the next word. This makes typing faster, more intelligent and reduces effort.

Counting of things in NLP is based on a corpus. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) provides a diverse set of corpora. For our project we'll be using the Brown corpus. The Brown corpus is a 1-million-word collection of samples from 500 written texts from different genres (newspaper, novels, non-fiction etc.). There are tasks such as spelling error detection, word prediction for which the location of the punctuation is important. Our application counts punctuation as words.

## Implementation 
### Designing a keyboard interface

The initial task was to design a keyboard interface as a web app. The keyboard layout consists of all keys which are present on a physical keyboard. The keyboard's interface will show the top three predictions for a given word sequence and suggest word-completion.

This interface was achieved by designing in HTML, CSS and dynamic behavior was made possible using JavaScript and AJAX.
